1. Each non-title Karate Combat contest shall be 3 rounds. Each round shall be 3 minutes in duration, with a rest period of 1 minute between each round. Title/Championship  fights are 5 rounds.

2. Preceding the bell to begin each bout the referee will instruct each fighter to perform a traditional karate bow to their opponent with the following commands: Yoi (ready), Otega-ni Rei (bow to each other).

3. During the fighting action when one fighter becomes grounded* the referee will signal with a raised hand to the timekeeper to start the countdown. A digital countdown timer will start to count back from five (5) to one (1) representing the length of time that the standing fighter may continue their legal attack and the downed fighter may fight back from the ground. The countdown will stop at the sound. In case the countdown timer is not available the referee will start an audible countdown from five (5) to one (1) At the end of the "Five-Count", the referee will separate the fighters, order the downed fighter to immediately stand and quickly restart the action from that same position in the pit. During th is restart, both fighters shall maintain their defense. A downed fighter who fails to immediately rise at the command of the referee risks warnings, penalization, disqualification or loss by TKO. The referee shall at their own discretion allow extra time for position to be maintained before starting the timer.

*The definition of a grounded fighter is determined by the regulatory jurisdiction if it differs in any way from the definition provided below: A fighter is considered grounded when any part of the body other than the soles of their feet are touching the fighting area floor

_Note: the Pit Wall is NOT considered the ground. In reference to the pit wall, a fighter shall only be considered grounded if he is directly facing the wall and has both hands on it. In this scenario the referee will indicate the start of the countdown._

4. When a fighter is attacking his downed opponent, he may do so only with hand strikes and he must maintain an upright and controlled position while attacking. When one of the fighters considered grounded hammerfist and ridge-hand strikes are not allowed. The "top" fighter may place a single knee on his downed opponent's body or beside his downed opponent, but once a second knee goes (and stays) down, or both fighters are considered grounded, the referee will stop the action, stand the fighters and immediately restart the action from that same position in the pit.
5. During the rest period between rounds, the fighters licensed second and cutman will enter the pit to address the fighters' needs under the supervision of a commission inspector.
6. Whenever a fighter is injured by a foul that causes time to be stopped or is finished by KO or TKO, the uninjured opponent shall assume the traditional kneeling position (seiza) on the opposite side of the pit until the opponent has recovered or the referee indicates that the uninjured fighter should rise.
7. A fighter may submit to his opponent by either tapping their hand continuously on any area of the pit, placing one knee on the ground and one hand above their head or by verbally submitting to the referee. A fighter's chief second may concede the match by a method determined by the presiding commission.

## 11. Stopping Contest

1. The referee and/or the ringside physician (as determined by the presiding commission) are the only individuals authorized to stop a contest.
2. The fighter's Chief Second may concede the match by a method determined by the presiding commission.
3. The fighter is permitted to concede the match to their opponent at any time during the bout by the following methods:
    - Tapping their hand continuously on any area of the PIT
    - Placing one knee on the ground and one hand above the head 
    - Verbally submitting to the referee

## 12. Judging/Scoring

1. All bouts will be evaluated and scored by 3 judges who shall evaluate the contest from different locations around the PIT fighting area. The referee may not be one of the 3 judges.
2. Judges shall evaluate the round score on effective striking, effective takedowns, control of the PIT fighting area, and effective aggressiveness.
3. Effective striking is evaluated by determining the total number of impactful legal strikes landed by a contestant
4. Effective takedowns are evaluated by considering the number of successful executions of a legal takedown followed by efforts to finish the fight.
5. Fighting area control is judged by determining who is dictating the pace, location and position of the bout.
6. Effective aggressiveness means moving forward and landing a legal strike.
7. A 10-point must system will be used during the bout based on effective fighting according to the criteria listed above. Karate Combat prioritizes productive  aggressiveness so the fighter who  gets results based on attacking should be favored over a fighter who counters if the results of the fighting action are similar.

## 20. The Dangers of Cutting Weight and Dehydrating

_(based on the Association of Ringside Physicians)_

Unhealthy and dangerous weight loss practices continue to be a serious problem in combat sports. It has been shown that excessive weight loss, rapid weight loss, and repeated cycling of weight gain/loss causes decreased performance, hormonal imbalance, decreased nutrition and increased injury risk. Other life-threatening problems associated with improper weight loss and dehydration include:

* Decreased Muscle Strength and Endurance: Decreased blood flow to muscles makes them work less well.
* Decreased Heart and Cardiovascular Function: The heart works harder and less efficiently.
* Reduced Energy Utilization, Nutrient Exchange and Acidosis: With decreased blood flow to tissues, nutrients don't get delivered, and the body's waste products do not get removed as well. A buildup of acid occurs which changes cells' functions in the body.
* Heat Illness: This takes on four forms: heat cramps, heat syncope (loss of consciousness), heat exhaustion, and heat stroke (which may be fatal). Dehydration results in decreased blood flow to the skin and muscles. This is followed by decreased ability to regulate body temperature. The ability to sweat becomes impaired and core body temperature can rise. This increases the threat of all of these to poorly hydrated athletes doing strenuous workouts.
* Decreased Kidney Function: Dehydration leads to decreased kidney blood flow and decreased kidney function. This contributes to the problems listed in the points here, in addition to decreased urine output, concentrated urine, and leakage of protein into the urine. (It is not known if these changes can result in permanent kidney damage.)
* Electrolyte Problems: Decreased kidney function results in imbalances of electrolytes such as unhealthy increases in potassium and sodium.
* Mood Swings and Mental Changes: All of the above contribute to increased mood swings, poor concentration and focus, disorientation and other mental changes.
* Eye Trouble: Dehydration can cause blurred vision and dry eyes.**
* Increased Risk of Brain Injury: There are likely increased risks of brain bleeding and concussion.

**_Do not:_**

* Don't use extreme methods for making weight such as excessive heat methods (rubberized suits, steam rooms, saunas), excessive intense bouts of exercise, vomiting, laxatives and diuretics.
* Don't use dehydration as a mainstay of making weight. In addition to the above, it puts you at risk of improper rehydration techniques — when, in reality, proper rehydration takes several hours to days. (Many cases of intravenous fluids being used for rehydration after weigh-ins have been reported – this is a doping violation with several organizations.)

**_Do:_**

* Commit to a year-round proper diet and training for proper weight control and body composition.
* By maintaining your weight year-round near an appropriate competition weight and not competing in a weight class outside your appropriate weight class you will help avoid large swings in weight.
* Maintain a good state of hydration by drinking fluid throughout the day and staying hydrated during workouts.

Follow nutritional programs that meet your needs for adequate amounts of calories from a balanced diet high in healthy carbohydrates, the minimum requirement of fat, and appropriate amounts of protein.
